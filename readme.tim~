TIMEUP 1.2 Readme file. 05/07/93

TIMEUP displays the amount of time since OS/2 2.0 was booted in the smallest
window possible... a titlebar.  The maximum length of time that TIMEUP can
record is 49 days, 17 hours, and 2 minutes. It updates the display every
10 seconds to minimize the CPU use and still retain a bit of accuracy.
It also writes the maximum time up out to disk every minute if it has
changed. It can then be left running along the top or bottom of the screen
with virtually no loss of screen space.

I have adapted this program from the program VMEM by M.B.Mallory.  I sincerely
recognize the work that he went through to produce the program VMEM which I
have included.  The source to VMEM is also include and modified by myself
so that it will compile under EMX 0.8f.

A few simple options can be accessed by selecting "TIMEUP Options"
from the system menu.

Double clicking on the title bar with the right mouse button will toggle
between displaying the maximum Time UP and the Time UP displays.

I will take no responsibility for any damage that this program may do to your
system or to any data that may be contained therein.

HISTORY
=======

v1.0	The first release

v1.01	Bug fix for 8514/a displays.  Recompiled to use emx.dll alone and
	to not need emxlibc.dll.  This resulted in an 8k larger executable but
	the 80k emxlibc.dll was no longer needed.

v1.2    Added the ability to store and recall the maximum up time.  Also,
	modified so that double-clicking on the title bar with the right
	mouse button toggles between maximum Time UP and Time UP
	A few modification made for a program that used a bit less CPU.
